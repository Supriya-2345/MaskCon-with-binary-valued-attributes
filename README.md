# MaskCon-with-binary-valued-attributes

This repository presents an enhancement to the MaskCon approach for masked contrastive learning, originally detailed in [MaskCon: Masked Contrastive Learning for Coarse-Labeled Dataset](https://github.com/MrChenFeng/MaskCon_CVPR2023). 

Our modification incorporates additional attributes from the dataset, specifically focusing on binary-valued attributes, to improve the model's performance and robustness. By integrating these attributes into the MaskCon framework, we aim to enhance the learning process for coarse-labeled datasets, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

Key features of our approach include:
- **Enhanced MaskCon Framework:** Modification of the original MaskCon technique to incorporate binary-valued attributes.
- **Improved Performance:** Utilization of additional dataset attributes to achieve better model performance.
- **Comprehensive Implementation:** Complete codebase demonstrating the integration of these enhancements.

For more details on the original MaskCon approach, please refer to the [MaskCon repository](https://github.com/MrChenFeng/MaskCon_CVPR2023).
